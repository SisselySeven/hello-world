Learning and explorig github!
Artist, philosopher, communitarian... programmer! What better way to combine all of my passions and talents--helping create, design, and launch peoples dreams into reality.

I have been programming on and off for ten years, building websites with HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and various content managment systems. They seem to make people happy, owner and clients alike. I am taking a deeper dive now, working on JavaScript programming, command line scripts, and some dev-ops software like Dockers and Virtual Box. My hope is to follow the most intriguing skill sets into a job/career that is supporting equity, justice, and planetary stability. Thanks for stopping by!
